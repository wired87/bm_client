# **App Name**: SwarmScape

## Core Features:

- 3D Map Rendering: Render a 3D map using Three.js with rectangular shapes, providing a visual representation of a geographical area.
- Swarm Simulation: Implement swarm dynamics to control the movement and interaction of elements on the map, simulating a swarm behavior.
- Dynamic Parameter Control: Provide a set of configurations (sliders or input boxes) for tuning and adjusting swarm dynamics, allowing users to experiment with different swarm behaviors by adjusting cohesion, separation, and alignment. The application uses these inputs as parameters within its swarm dynamics formulas to modify the behavior of the simulated swarm.
- Interactive Camera Controls: Implement user controls to modify the camera position, zoom level, and viewing angle, allowing users to explore the 3D map from different perspectives.
- Height map adjustment: Integrate a tool that analyzes the distribution and density of swarm elements and uses LLM reasoning to adjust rectangle heights, dynamically highlighting significant clusters or areas of interest.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to represent the expansive and dynamic nature of simulated environments, as often depicted in visualizations of weather or topographical patterns.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) to enhance the contrast and depth of the 3D elements, ensuring the dynamic swarm patterns stand out against a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) to highlight interactive elements and areas of focus within the map, complementing the blue tones and adding a touch of sophistication.
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for labels and UI elements to maintain readability and a futuristic feel.
- Implement minimalistic, outlined icons for camera controls and other interactive features to ensure clarity without overwhelming the visual space.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for camera movements and swarm adjustments to enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.
